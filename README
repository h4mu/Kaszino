NOTE
I have written an Installer which is quite pretty, but does not seem to copy correctly. If you are interested in pretty, but non-functioning Installer programs, then you can use the .bas sources and run them from QBASIC. QBASIC is usually shipped with the MS-DOS operating systems, but can also be found on some Windows Installation disks.

TROUBLESHOOT
If you can't exit from the program don't panic. It's not a bug, it's a feature =D. If you really want to quit you should try and press N instead of Y =).

ENJOY!
